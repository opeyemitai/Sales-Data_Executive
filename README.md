Sales Executive Report Dashboard

In this Project i calculated the Revenue and Profit for DTLM Retail. Made reports for revenue trend,top 5 products by revenue,revenue contribution(%) of the categories, the top 10 sales team by revenue,top 10 states by revenue,their population and median income per state for DTML Retail. Created a dashboard with reports and made it sliceable by product category and timeline. I included a textbox to highlight the 2 top revenue products in January, the sales team that made the most revenue from Decoratives in March and also determine the relationship between revenue,population and median income of the states insights in it.
